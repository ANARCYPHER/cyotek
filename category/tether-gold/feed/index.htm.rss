										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re pleased to announce that Tether Gold (XAU₮)*, a digital token backed by physical gold, has been listed on financial technology exchange, BTSE. </p>



<p>BTSE commenced trading in XAU₮ on 19th May 2020, 09.00 AM (GMT). XAU₮’s listing on BTSE further underlines the popularity and trust in XAU₮ as a blockchain-based token that offers the capabilities to own a fractional amount of what is commonly viewed as the world’s most reliable precious metal at low cost, which is not possible traditionally. </p>



<p>For more information on BTSE, please visit: <a href="https://www.btse.com/en/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.btse.com/en/about-us/</a></p>



<p>Prior to this listing, XAU₮ has been listed on four exchanges – <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitfinex</a>, RenrenBit, <a href="https://tether.to/ftx-lists-tether-gold-xaut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a>, <a href="https://celsius.network/earn-gold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celsius Network</a>, and <a href="https://blog.deversifi.com/deversifi-lists-tethergold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeversiFi</a>. It has reached an approximately <a href="https://wallet.tether.to/transparency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$87 million</a> of market capitalization, which makes XAU₮ the world’s biggest gold-backed stablecoin, far surpassing its predecessors and nearest rivals.</p>



<p>XAU₮ was launched in January this year to help meet the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/interest-in-gold-backed-token-trading-grows-amid-supply-disruptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increased</a> interest in gold-backed digital tokens as investors seek more stable forms of investment in response to the significant economic disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
